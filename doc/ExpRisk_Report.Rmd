## Risk elicited
In this study, the Eckle and Grossman risk elicitation task was implemented before and after the participants experience 24 realizations of the tasks. These correspond with **Gamble.1** and **Gamble.2** variables. The next table show the 6 gambles presented to the participants; events **odd** and **even** are equally probable and they had to choose only one gamble.

Notice the expected payoff is increasing from Gamble 1 to 5, and then it decreases to 34 (the same as gamble 4), but in this case choosing gamble 6 clearly elicits risk loving preferences.

## Experience periods

The 24 experience periods correspond to realization of a gamble chosen. 
In the first 12, a gamble was pre-selected (variables **R1** to **R12**) and the participants throw two dice to determine the events (variables **E1** to **E12**) and wrote down the corresponding payoff (variables **P1** to **P12**).
In the last 12, a gamble was chosen by the participants (variables **F1** to **F12**) and the participants throw two dice to determine the events (variables **EF1** to **EF12**) and wrote down the corresponding payoff (variables **PF1** to **PF12**).
The 24 periods of realizations didn't affected the final payoff, but one of them (**Period.to.review**) was selected to check if they wrote down the correct payoff and then earned an extra dollar (**Correct.Payoff**).
