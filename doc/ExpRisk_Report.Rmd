## Risk elicited

In this study, the Eckle and Grossman risk elicitation task was implemented before and after the participants experience 24 realizations of the tasks. These correspond with **Gamble.1** and **Gamble.2** variables. Next table show the 6 gambles presented to the participants; events **odd** and **even** are equally probable and they had to choose only one gamble.

Notice the expected payoff is increasing from Gamble 1 to 5, and then it decreases to 34 (the same as gamble 4), but in this case choosing gamble 6 clearly elicits risk loving preferences.

## Experience periods

The 24 experience periods correspond to realization of a gamble chosen. 
In the first 12, a gamble was pre-selected (variables **R1** to **R12**) and the participants throw two dice to determine the events (variables **E1** to **E12**) and wrote down the corresponding payoff (variables **P1** to **P12**).
In the last 12, a gamble was chosen by the participants (variables **F1** to **F12**) and the participants throw two dice to determine the events (variables **EF1** to **EF12**) and wrote down the corresponding payoff (variables **PF1** to **PF12**).
The 24 periods of realizations didn't affected the final payoff, but one of them (**Period.to.review**) was selected to check if they wrote down the correct payoff and then earned an extra dollar (**Correct.Payoff**).

# Hypothesis 1: Participants display larger levels of risk tolerance

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ExperienceRisk_Sessions %>% 
         select(Gamble.1,Gamble.2) %>% 
         gather("Gamble_Order","Gamble") ) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = factor(Gamble),fill = Gamble_Order),position="dodge")+
  labs(x = "Gamble Number", fill = "Gamble Order")
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = ExperienceRisk_Sessions) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = factor(Gamble.1),fill = factor(sign_gamble)),position="dodge")+
  labs(x = "Gamble Number",fill= "Directional \nChange of \nGamble")
```

The Wilcox test shows that the difference is significant at 5% when analyzing the hypothesis that Gamble 2 is greater. 
```{r}
wilcox.test(x = ExperienceRisk_Sessions$simple_diff,alternative = "greater")

data1 <-
ExperienceRisk_Sessions %>% 
  mutate(ID= 1:99) %>% 
    select(Gamble.1,Gamble.2,ID) %>% 
    gather("Gamble_Order","Gamble") 

friedman.test(y = data1$Gamble,groups = data1$Gamble_Order)
pairwise.wilcox.test(x = data1$Gamble,g = data1$Gamble_Order,p.adjust.method = "bonf")

```



```{r}
ExperienceRisk_Sessions %>% tabyl(Gamble.1,Gamble.2)
```
